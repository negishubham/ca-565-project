# CA-565-Project
Computer architecture project repository

This github repository contains the codes for neural network based branch predictor and YAGS branch predictor. 

cbp4/bpc6421AU16/sim contains main.cc and tracer.cc which are edited to save the PC and branch outcome values to text files. 

create_dataset.py file uses the trace from CBP-4 to generate train and test. create_dataset.sh can be used to generate the dataset for all the benchmarks. 

train.py and models.py are the python files used in pytorch to train and test the neural network models.
